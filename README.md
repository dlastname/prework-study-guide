## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project is something I have put together to help study for my coding bootcamp. 
There are multiple subjects listed in order to help someone through each topic.

I built this project in order to start learning the basics of each language individually. It also serves as a centralized location to find all my notes.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains notes about the topic listed. There is a function running in the console that can randomly assign you a topic to study. 
This project will be continuously updated with notes that reflect my progress through the bootcamp.
